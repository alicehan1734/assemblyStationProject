1.why was necessary to use binary files in this workshop and how did you use them
-> 
When i use the binary files in c++, It is faster to read and write data because it does not waste time converting data from one format to another. 
In that reasons, i used the binary like this "fstream fs(file, std::ios::out|std::ios::binary);" for my files. 

2.why would be important to bind a function to its arguments, and how was it useful in this workshop
-> 
In this workshop, where functions must be called occasionally to solve problems, such as scheduled routines, binding functions was useful.
Because they could make threads simpler and reduce work intensity.

3.the advantages of using multiple threads, and how did you accomplished multi-threading in this workshop
-> It ensures labor-intensive because the process is divided into different threads running simultaneously. 
For that reason, it can greatly speed up tasks such as loops and repetitions.
This has the advantage of shortening response time when performing multi-threading tasks (or processes) in this workshop 9.
