//I confirm that the content of this file is created by me, with the exception of the parts provided to me by my professor.

I am honored to take an OOP345 class from the professor. 
I learned a lot while doing workshops and milestones.

First of all, I put a lot of difficulties in memory leak while doing many assignments.
Managing memory was the most difficult, and it really took a lot of time. 
Also, I knew that making Templates was my most vulnerable point, and even after this OOP345,
I think I'll have to study more deeply about it.
